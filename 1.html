  <p><strong>Anyone</strong> who reads Old and Middle English literary texts will be familiar with
  the mid-brown volumes of the EETS, with the symbol of Alfred's jewel embossed on the front cover.
  </p><p style="margin-top:80px;">Most of the works attributed to King Alfred or to Aelfric, along with some of those by bishop
  Wulfstan and much anonymous prose and verse from the pre-Conquest period, are to be found
  within the Society's three series; all of the surviving medieval drama, most of the Middle
  English romances, much religious and secular prose and verse including the English works of
  John Gower, Thomas Hoccleve and most of Caxton's prints all find their place in the publications.
  Without EETS editions, study of medieval English texts would hardly be possible.</p>
